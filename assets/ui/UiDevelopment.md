# UI Development

Some standards?

* Anchors over Positions
* AAP Splendor From Aseprite for Palette Choice on UI
* White 2 pixel borders with squared corners
* White fonts, white borders
* Use scenes, as much as you like
* Use just control nodes at the top of a scene, in case you need to reparent anything below
* The top node should link to the main code entry point, this is again to make style choices avoid the code
